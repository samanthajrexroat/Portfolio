# Portfolio

## Description

        In this application, I have created a portfolio for myself.  
    There is a navigation bar with links to the three main sections of the portfolio. These sections are: About, Work and Contact. My name and a recent picture are displayed. The most current project appears larger, and because I only have one project in total, that is the only external link that is referenced.  In addition, the layout is responsive and media queries were included to create a responsive design.
